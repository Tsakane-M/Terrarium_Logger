# Terrarium_Logger

The project is to create an IoT terrarium logger. An IoT system enables the integrating of 
communications, control and information processing across various transportation systems. The 
purpose of the terrarium logger is to serve as a system that the client can get information about the 
surrounding environment.

The first phase of development of the environment allows the user to manually and physically 
interact with the system through the Raspberry Pi terminal. Part B of the project will implement 
remote access by means of the Blynk interface.

The development of the Terrarium logger was done on the Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a temperature 
sensor (MCP9700). The output data is converted to digital output by means on an ADC (MCP3008). 
The MCP3008 allows for multiple channels that can be used to read multiple inputs. In the second 
phase of development an IoT Blynk is configured and it is used to access and control the system data 
remotely.

The development of the system followed the agile methodology. This approach allows for dynamic 
and iterative planning, development, testing and implementation of the project. The project 
development plan is detailed in the Gantt chart. For the project design and analysis UML artefacts 
including a use-case diagram, class diagram, state-machine and flow chart diagram are used to 
depict the system design and functions.
